# Dunbar Resilient Network project - concept note

## Introduction

What if a small coastal town in Scotland had a resilient network of sensors and repeaters, at once linked to the internet of things (IOT) and allowing communication if disconnected. This project aims to explore the social and economic potential of a reslient network

## Context

Dunbar is a well connected town in East Lothian Scotland, 40kms from Edinburgh. It has a mix of local employment and commuting to Edinburgh and the central belt. Local employers include a cement works and the Torness Nuclear Power station Population is approx. 15,000 (2020) with a growing housing stock. The neighbouring countryside is prime agricultural land. There are a number of primary schools in the area as well as a high school. The main train line from Edinburgh to London stops in Dunbar. The port serves fishing and leisure traffic, and the seaside is popular for surfing, diving and sea kayaking

## Experiment

This project could be considered a complex intervention - does a community investment in IOT increase resilience and social wellbeing. 

Resilience could be framed in terms of quality of response or operational continuity in the face of specific threats. These could be modelled, scenarios planned and tests run:

- long term climate change
- storms
- floods
- power outage
- communication network failure
- economic recession
- pandemic lockdown

## Local manufacturing & knowledge management

A key component of this proposal is the retention of knowledge and skills and the creation of local jobs, however temporary. Although electronics are not manufactured locally, the equipment required for this project will be assembled and in some cases manufactured in Dunbar. Working with schools and the Dunbar community maker space, a mix of adult, student/school age and retired volunteer workers will be recruited, trained and employed. Additionally, external consultants will be engaged to advise on designs, processes and operational aspects. 

As far as possible, training and knowledge gathered during this project will be shared in an online archive (e.g. a wiki) and available for replication in other communities. 

## Project structure

The project is imagined as a 5 year intervention, with an initial 2 year build and operate phase, followed by the option to continue for another 3. Long term thinking is required, but it is also important to allow for early re-assessment and adaptation of project goals.

Year 1 

- Community consultation
- Design
- Prototype build and small scale tests
- Large scale deployment

Year 2

- Continuous operation
- Resilience tests
- Community assessment
- Y3-5 decision


## Technical description

The Dunbar Resilient Network is expected to comprise a number of low power devices distributed across the Dunbar environment, safely deployed and fastened for continued operation through four seasons and hardened for adverse weather conditions. Each device comprises

- sensors (see below) with continuous streaming of data
- security features ensuring authorised use
- gateways to existing commercial or government communication networks
- the ability, in parallel, to support a self-contained network (see below)
- the ability to host paid-for applications from 3rd party customers (see Governance)

Nodes will necessarily be located on citizen's properties but will not be considered personal. The project will be responsible for their operation and use.

Devices will be manufactured to a design tested in 

## Sensors

The proposed list of passive sensors deployed at each device:

- time
- location (GPS?)
- orientation (in 3 dimensions)
- motion
- heat
- temperature
- air pressure
- noise
- radioactivity
- air quality (volatile organic compounds VOCs)
- connectivity tests (local & external networks)

No visual or sound capture or recording sensors will be included.

## Governance

Part of the social innovation is to explore the governance and ethics of the new network. Who owns the data, who has access to the data needs to be clear. Community awareness and oversight will be essential. 

A community oversight board will approve 3rd party customer applications and data use rights. Any profit from this project will be re-invested in the project with priorities defined by the community but expected to preserve:

1. Continuity of the system
2. Employment 
3. Knowledge management
